        <p>
            For our first lab in CIS 3344, Client-Side Scripting for the Web, I created a html website using
            multiple html pages and used one css stylesheet to style my pages.

            I took a html class in high school and all we did was copy code.
            I'm not kidding I was actually handed a worksheet of html code and my assignments were to copy
            whatever I saw on the worksheet into my html editor, so I didn't truly learn how to create things
            on my own which is why I'm so glad to be taking this class to learn how to do it myself.
            <br />
            Some of the advanced css techniques I used were using my own font, floating elements to position them, using display: flex to make pictures side by side, and using border radius to round out the
            corners of pictures.
            <br />
            What I liked about this assignment was that I get to share information about myself and my interests which is something
            I often don't get to do.
